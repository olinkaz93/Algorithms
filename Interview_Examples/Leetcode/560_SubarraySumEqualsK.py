"""
 Further, for every sum encountered, we also determine the number of times the sum sum-ksumâˆ’k has occurred already, since it will determine the number of times a subarray with sum kk has occurred up to the current index. We increment the countcount by the same amount.

After the complete array has been traversed, the countcount gives the required result.

The animation below depicts the process.

    # 1) First approach, slow, we iterate by every element

    # 2) Keep the HASH MAP, and we will keep the CUMULATIVE SUM
    # We loop thorugh the numbers, and we store the sums in the ditionary
    # THINK ABOUT SUBSTRACTION, of the
